## Receive this course as a gift

We need financial support to care for our material needs, and it doesn’t necessarily mean this support comes from this course. We are making our financial needs visible in the registration form and intend to update it regularly. And we want you to participate based on purpose and capacity discernment, not based on access to financial resources. For us, this is part of becoming a Convergent Facilitator: to find integration across differences, we need to be able to let go of “deserve thinking” and help others do so, too. This way liberative and creative solutions can arise, which are not limited by how much someone has contributed already or “should” contribute, but are based entirely on who has willingness and capacity to do something.

## What is Convergent Facilitation? & Why learn it?

We live in a time of multiple devastating crises and challenges - could we come together to find a way to turn things around? 

Convergent Facilitation (CF) is a powerful approach to facilitating collaborative decision making. It holds massive potential for those working to bring communities, stakeholders and movements together to address our most challenging problems. 

It is a process for getting to a genuine agreement about how to move forward with any shared practical problem or disagreement. It’s particularly transformative with highly polarised issues, helping people find practical ways forward that address what really matters to everyone involved, in an efficient way. CF has helped people in a range of contexts around the World reach creative solutions to complex challenges, where no-one loses or is left behind. The principles of CF can enhance any kind of group facilitation and collaboration.

If you work with groups, organisations, communities or diverse stakeholders trying to make the World a better place, CF could make a big difference to your ability to:

- Find what is important to everyone in a group in a way that brings people together, even when that might seem impossible
- Support a group to come up with creative ways of fulfilling all the needs people have for a solution, in a meaningful way
- Check carefully for any concerns and actively engage with disagreement about any proposals or ideas, and respond by improving solutions until everyone can genuinely say yes to them
- Engage with imbalances of power and group dynamics, facilitating real collaboration
- Help groups move forwards in clear, effective ways

## Where might you apply CF? & Who is this course for?
We are keen to offer this training to people who have a clear context to put their learning into practice, and in particular to people who are actively engaged in:

Participatory/Deliberative Democracy (e.g. People’s Assemblies, Citizen’s Assemblies, etc.) 
Community Organising
Progressive Social Movements - trying to build a world that’s sustainable and works for all
Mediation, Conflict Resolution, Collaborative Facilitation, etc.

## What will the course involve?
This course will run over 5 weeks in November and December 2024, online. It will involve watching the 4 recordings of the March course by Paul and Verene (roughly 1.5hr each), participating in or observing a live demo by Paul (optional, 90mins), participating in 2hr-weekly Q&A and practice sessions based on the March course recordings, and joining a Q&A session with Aimee Ryan (optional, 90mins) to explore how she used CF to facilitate a major decision-making process in the area of pest management in California. 

It's entirely possible to take part in the course and not join Paul's live demo and/or Aimee's Q&A session. Recordings of these 2 events will be available for registered participants. Attendance to all live practice sesssions is highly recommended. Unless you took part in the March course, we have a high threshold request that you watch the relevant March course's recording before joining the weekly Q&A and practice session you've signed up for. 

Those sessions will consist of a brief recap of each session's content, space for Q&A and practice in small groups. 

Other CF facilitators might join the weekly live sessions to support Verene, Paul and participants.


## After this Course 

We are working on a new amazing coaching offering, that involves scenario based role-playing, facilitation and live coaching of the person facilitating by an experienced Convergent Facilitaton coach. We imagine this to be a very potent way to experiment with, practice and get immediate feedback on applying Convergent Facilitation process and principles. Besides that, we invite you engage with other learnerns and practitioners in our [Community of Practice](https://community.convergentfacilitation.org).
