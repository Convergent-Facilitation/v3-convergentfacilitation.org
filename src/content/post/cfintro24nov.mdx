# About the Offering

This course is the new iteration of a in-depth introduction to Convergent Facilitation that happened in March 2024, to which we have added 2 special events: one is a live demo by Paul which anyone who has registered can either observe or participate in (by taking a role) - more information here. The other is a Q&A session with Aimee Ryan regarding the California Pest Management project [link to case study page].

# What is Convergent Facilitation? & Why learn it?

We live in a time of multiple devastating crises and challenges - could we come together to find a way to turn things around? 

CF is a powerful approach to facilitating collaborative decision making. It holds massive potential for those working to bring communities, stakeholders and movements together to address our most challenging problems. 

It is a process for getting to a genuine agreement about how to move forward with any shared practical problem or disagreement. It’s particularly transformative with highly polarised issues, helping people find practical ways forward that address what really matters to everyone involved, in an efficient way. CF has helped people in a range of contexts around the World reach creative solutions to complex challenges, where no-one loses or is left behind. The principles of CF can enhance any kind of group facilitation and collaboration.

If you work with groups, organisations, communities or diverse stakeholders trying to make the World a better place, CF could make a big difference to your ability to:

- Find what is important to everyone in a group in a way that brings people together, even when that might seem impossible
- Support a group to come up with creative ways of fulfilling all the needs people have for a solution, in a meaningful way
- Check carefully for any concerns and actively engage with disagreement about any proposals or ideas, and respond by improving solutions until everyone can genuinely say yes to them
- Engage with imbalances of power and group dynamics, facilitating real collaboration
- Help groups move forwards in clear, effective ways


# Where might you apply CF? & Who is this course for?
We are keen to offer this training to people who have a clear context to put their learning into practice, and in particular to people who are actively engaged in:

Participatory/Deliberative Democracy (e.g. People’s Assemblies, Citizen’s Assemblies, etc.) 
Community Organising
Progressive Social Movements - trying to build a world that’s sustainable and works for all
Mediation, Conflict Resolution, Collaborative Facilitation, etc.


# What will the course involve?
This course will run over 6 weeks in November and December 2024, online. It will involve watching the 4 recordings of the March course by Paul and Verene (roughly 1.5hr each), participating in or observing a live demo by Paul (90mins), participating in 2hr-weekly Q&A and practice sessions based on the recordings of the March 24 course facilitated by Paul and Verene, and joining a Q&A session with Aimee Ryan (90mins) to explore how she used CF to facilitate a major CF process in the area of pest management in California. 

It's entirely possible to take part in the course and not join Paul's live demo and/or Aimee's Q&A session. Recordings of these 2 events will be available for registered participants. Attendance to all live practice sesssions is highly recommended. Unless you took part in the March course, we have a high threshold request that you watch each week's recording before joining the Q&A and practice session. 

Those sessions will consist of a brief recap of the content of each week's session, space to ask questions to Verene or Paul (depending on which group you join), and practice in small groups. 

Other CF facilitators will join the weekly live sessions to support Verene, Paul and participants.

# About the providers
- Paul Kahawatte
Paul is a highly experienced mediator, facilitator and trainer, who has worked extensively in supporting people through conflict, collaborative decision making and the development of collaborative systems. Paul is one of the World’s leading practitioners of Convergent Facilitation, as well as mediation based in Nonviolent Communication (NVC). He draws on numerous other approaches in his work, including Restorative Circles, Aikido, Focusing, Relational Neuroscience and many others. He has worked doing mediation and facilitation in community and social movement contexts, as well as work in the field of deliberative democracy, and has run trainings in the UK, Sri Lanka, USA, Bangladesh and several European Countries.

- Verene Nicolas
Verene is an experienced facilitator and certified trainer in Nonviolent Communication. She has delivered training and facilitated group decisions in many grassroots contexts. Her immersion in the Nonviolent Global Liberation (NGL) community where CF is practiced daily gives her a deep grounding in the power of this approach to sustain ‘radical collaboration’ across differences of all sorts.
