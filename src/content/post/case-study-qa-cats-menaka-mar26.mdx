**About the project**: In a housing community in New Delhi, India, a seemingly small issue of stray cats turned into a deep conflict, dividing neighbors between those who wished to care for cats and those who were frustrated by their growing numbers and impacts. Through a process of Convergent Facilitation (CF) stewarded by resident and facilitator Menaka Neotia, the community found a way forward that fostered collaboration, addressed concerns, and created agreements that care for both cats and humans. This example demonstrates the power of CF in transforming entrenched conflicts into opportunities for growth, trust-building, and increasing collective capacity.


**‚≠ê About this session**: Menaka will take questions and offer insights and reflections on the practice of Convergent Facilitation in this context. The session will be facilitated by Julia Sherbakov who also supported Menaka in writing the case study.

### About Menaka 

![image menaka](~/assets/images/menaka.jpeg)

Menaka Neotia has faith that if humanity grows back it's capacity to integrate, we may actually begin experiencing living more in flow with life and not at odds with it. She began facilitating CF in the colony she lives in in India because she wanted the community she closely lives with to experience nonviolence in this way, and support them to care for impacts by integrating the information within it and not avoid it so that they are able to make decisions that impact the community more effectively. She hopes to continue practicing CF and offering the gifts it brings as a step towards creating a world that can actually work for all.
