## About this Event

**Date & Time**: <LocalTimeFromUTC client:load  startUtcTime="2024-11-08T15:30:00Z" endUtcTime="2024-11-08T17:00:00Z"/> (local time based on your device's time zone)


With this CF Process Live Demo we want to give people a visceral sense of what a Convergent Facilitation process *feels* like, so that people can experience it without having to learn it first or find a way to participate in an actual process. 

Convergent Facilitation offers those who facilitate decisions in groups an overarching structure to lean on, a set of principles (informed by a commitment to nonviolence and a particular understanding of and faith in human nature) to guide their facilitation over all, as well as a set of specific facilitation "moves" (e.g. "threshold questions"), all of which together make convergence possible where it has often been impossible previously. Learning *about* this process, principles and facilitation moves can often seem abstract and make it difficult to develop trust that Convergent Facilitation can deliver what it promises: Solutions that work for everyone.

With this live demo event we want to start a series of live demos offered by different facilitators (who each model different strengths and ways of facilitating) in different contexts. We want to record these demos and make them available on our website, as an easily accessible way to increase people's understanding of and trust in Convergent Facilitation.

**Recording**: We intend to record this session. Only people who speak will be visible on the recording.

**Using role-plays**: Given the unusually high degree of intimacy and vulnerability that Convergent Facilitation processes ask of stakeholders, three people will role-play the participants in this process (you can indicate in the registration if you would be open to step into role-play). 

**Scenario**: We haven't decided yet on the exact scenario, but we want it to reflect an aspect of the increasing jarring global polarization. We intend to update this page once we know. 

## Join Us

**What we are asking of you as an observer**:
- come with an energetic of support and curiosity towards the person facilitating and those role-playing (people will try and step into the stakeholders as truly as possible and so it will still be a vulnerable situation for them!)
- keep your camera on if possible to give everyone a sense of your presence 
- if you leave before the end of the event please share an appreciation or celebration of what you have witnessed, so that people leaving does not create an energy leak
