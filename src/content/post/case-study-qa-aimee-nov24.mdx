**About the project**: CF Facilitator Aimee Ryan works with California's agriculture sector, where she was called to bring a holistic and collaborative approach to transforming pest management. Using Convergent Facilitation, a highly diverse group of stakeholders developed a roadmap for an accelerated transition away from high-risk pesticides toward the adoption of safer and sustainable pest control practices by 2050. Every word in the document was agreed through consensus, and the roadmap is now used daily by state regulators. 

**About this session**: Aimee will take questions and offer insights and reflections on the practice of Convergent Facilitation in this context.The session will be facilitated by Sabine Virani who wrote the case study.
