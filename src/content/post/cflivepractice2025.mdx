## Why live coaching? 

Many facilitators have taken intro and intermediate Convergent Facilitation (CF) courses, but struggle to confidently practice CF in their life or work. To more practically support a group of committed up-and-coming CF facilitators, a new offering is available for CF practitioners to role-play real scenarios, supported by experienced coaches coaching them along the way. 

## Why focus on polarization?

Current political and cultural events have contributed to work spaces or living communities becoming more divided into strong camps, which can show up in being unable to see the underlying needs of others, or closing down to seeing broader solutions that could work for all.

## Who is this for?


This offering will include coaching for a small group, who have already completed intro and intermediate courses, and are ready to bring scenarios from their life to practice CF. 

We invite CF practitioners, learners and CF-curious to participate and learn together – to role play, observe and hold the field.

## When?

## Gift economy

We offer this course as gift. This means we do not want that anyone gives anything *in return* to participate in this course.

And we still need financial support to care for our material needs from somewhere — and it doesn’t necessarily mean this support comes from this course! 

We are making our financial needs visible in the registration form and intend to update it regularly. And we want you to participate based on purpose and capacity discernment, not based on your own access to financial resources. For us, this is part of becoming a Convergent Facilitator: to find integration across differences, we need to be able to let go of “deserve thinking” and deeply engrained habits of "fairness" and "exchange" and help others do so, too. 

This way liberative and creative solutions can arise, which are not limited by how much someone has contributed already or “should” contribute, but are based entirely on who has willingness and capacity to do something.
