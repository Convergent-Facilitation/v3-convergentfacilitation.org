### Why live coaching? 

Many facilitators have taken intro and intermediate Convergent Facilitation (CF) courses, but struggle to confidently practice CF in their life or work. To more practically support a group of committed up-and-coming CF facilitators, a new offering is available for CF practitioners to role-play real scenarios, supported by experienced coaches coaching them along the way. 

### Why focus on polarization?

Current political and cultural events have contributed to work spaces or living communities becoming more divided into strong camps, which can show up in being unable to see the underlying needs of others, or closing down to seeing broader solutions that could work for all.

### Who is this for?

A core group of 6 facilitators, who have already completed intro and intermediate courses, and are ready to bring scenarios from their life to practice CF. One person at a time would be a facilitator, and bring a scenario from their life to facilitate.
In addition to the core group, the invitation is extended to CF practitioners and facilitators curious about CF to participate – to role play, observe and hold the field.

### When?

### Roni Wiener

Roni advocates for personal empowerment and social change through coaching, teaching, consulting, and activism. They enjoy sharing my passion and insights in diverse settings and scales, from small groups to large organizations. My life journey includes two decades of consulting focused on transforming collaboration practices, extensive work in technology projects and design, and an interdisciplinary degree in Psychology, Sociology, and Gender Studies. They offer fun and interactive workshops on topics ranging from process improvement and project planning to nonviolence, relationships, and sexual health. At other times, they may be found on the dance floor, at the beach, cuddling, playing games, engaging in deep conversations, writing an unpublished blog, and plotting global liberation. For more information, visit Roni’s website. Roni can facilitate in English and Hebrew.

### Verene Nicolas

Verene is an experienced facilitator and certified trainer in Nonviolent Communication. She has delivered training and facilitated group decisions in many grassroots contexts. Her immersion in the Nonviolent Global Liberation (NGL) community where CF is practiced daily gives her a deep grounding in the power of this approach to sustain ‘radical collaboration’ across differences of all sorts.
Verene supported Paul in designing and delivering the March introductory course.
