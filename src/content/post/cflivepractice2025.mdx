#### Why live coaching? 

Many facilitators have taken intro and intermediate CF courses, but struggle to confidently practice CF in their life or work. To more practically support a group of committed up-and-coming CF facilitators, a new offering is available for experienced CF to practice real scenarios, supported by experienced coaches coaching them in role-plays of real scenarios. 

#### Why focus on polarization?

Current political and cultural events have contributed to work spaces or living communities becoming more divided into strong camps, which can show up in being unable to see the underlying needs of others, or closing down to seeing broader solutions that could work for all.

#### Who is this for?

A core group of 6 facilitators, who have already completed intro and intermediate courses, and are ready to bring scenarios from their life to practice CF. One person at a time would be a facilitator, and bring a scenario from their life to facilitate.  
The invitation is extended to CF practitioners and CF-curious to participate in the audience – to role play, observe and hold the field.

#### When?

2-2.5-hour sessions, over 6 weeks, starting May into June

Paul is a highly experienced mediator, facilitator and trainer, who has worked extensively in supporting people through conflict, collaborative decision making and the development of collaborative systems.

He draws on numerous other approaches in his work, including Restorative Circles, Aikido, Focusing, Relational Neuroscience and many others.

### Verene Nicolas

Verene is an experienced facilitator and certified trainer in Nonviolent Communication. She has delivered training and facilitated group decisions in many grassroots contexts. Her immersion in the Nonviolent Global Liberation (NGL) community where CF is practiced daily gives her a deep grounding in the power of this approach to sustain ‘radical collaboration’ across differences of all sorts.
Verene supported Paul in designing and delivering the March introductory course.
